# Guitar object

I chose my guitar as an object from my daily life.

# This object has the following properties:

- Brand (string), the manufactorer of the guitar.
- Strings (number), the amount of strings on the guitar.
- Acoustic (boolean), set to true because it is an acoustic guitar.
- Sound (boolean), initially set to false because there is initially no sound from the guitar.
- Tuning (array), an array containing the notes of the guitar strings.
- Play (function), a function that toggles "sound"-property (true and false) based on if the guitar is played on (makes sound) or not (does not make sound).

There is also a button that can be clicked to start or stop playing on the guitar. This button calls the play-function which toggles the sound value (true and false).
